# Car Rental System in C

This repository contains the implementation of a Car Rental System, developed as part of a university course in C programming. The system aims to streamline vehicle rental management by offering functionalities such as browsing available cars, registering new reservations, and efficiently managing rental operations. The project is implemented entirely in C, utilizing file-based data handling, and is designed as a console-based application.
